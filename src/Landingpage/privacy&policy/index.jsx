    <div className="container" id="terms_of" style={{ padding: "50px 0 100PX",color:"" }}>
     <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
     <p>At Dr.Hero, healthcare personnel, together with technical personnel, work jointly to develop and provide healthcare. For us at Dr.Hero, you as an individual and as a patient always come first, and this privacy notice (the “Privacy Notice”) explains how we handle your personal data when you sign up to and use our App and when you seek healthcare or similar services from us (the “Services”).
    </p>
    <p>We explain in more detail in this Privacy Notice how Dr.Hero works for you as a “user” and “patient” and who is responsible for the processing of personal data, which is carried out in connection with your use of the Services. We also describe which personal data about you is processed when you use the Services, how we process the personal data, and why. We also describe the legal basis for our processing and external parties which may handle personal data about you in order for us to provide you with the Services. You also receive information about your rights in relation to the processing of your personal data and what you can do to exercise these rights.</p>
    <h3>2. Who is responsible for the processing of personal data?</h3>
    <p>RAW Medical Services LLC, company reg. no. XXXXXXX (“RAW Medical”), the parent company in the Dr.Hero group, is a UAE company that owns and makes available the ”Dr.Hero” technical platform and application (the “App”) and is the data controller for the processing of the personal data, which you register in the App, up until the time at which you commence contact with a healthcare provider for medical advice and follow-up. When you seek healthcare from Dr.Hero, it is solely established healthcare providers who are responsible for providing the healthcare, including the processing of personal data carried out in connection with providing you with healthcare. Healthcare Services typically start when you give us information about your health status via a self-assessment or pre-meeting questionnaire and include other activities such as consultation, record keeping, and necessary administration of your matter as further described below on this Privacy Notice.
    </p>
    <p>In the UAE, it is RAW Medical’s wholly owned affiliate, My Skin Clinic LLC, company reg. No. XXXXXX, which provides healthcare within the Services (the “Healthcare Provider”), unless the identity of another healthcare provider is communicated to you in connection with your use of the Services. Therefore, when you start a consultation in the App, and for all subsequent processing of personal data related to the provisioning of healthcare to you, My Skin Clinic LLC (or such other healthcare provider as is communicated to you, “Third Party Healthcare Provider” below) is the data controller. Where a Third Party Healthcare Provider provides you with healthcare, its privacy policy and not this Privacy Notice applies to their processing of your personal data which is carried out in the context of providing you with healthcare.
    </p>
    <p>When the Healthcare Provider or a Third Party Healthcare Provider is providing healthcare to you, RAW Medical acts as a data processor for the processing of personal data necessary to provide the technical platform and related services. This means that data related directly to your consultation is only processed according to the instructions of the Healthcare Provider or Third Party Healthcare provider. In the event another healthcare provider joins the Dr.Hero platform and processes your personal data in connection to your use of the Services, we will inform you when you use the Services so that you always know which healthcare provider is the controller of your personal data.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li style={{color:"#000",fontWeight:"bold",fontSize:"20px"}}>Contacts</li>

</p>

<h3>4. Where is your personal data stored?
</h3>
<h4>User Data, Identification Data, and Health Data</h4>
<p>This personal data is stored by RAW Medical, in infrastructure provided by one of RAW Medical’s subcontracted processors. User Data is handled and stored primarily within the UAE and MENA regions. Health Data is always handled and stored within the UAE and MENA</p>
<h4>Patient Data</h4>
<p>The Healthcare Provider is obligated to maintain medical records when performing the Services.

Your Patient Data is handled and stored within the UAE and MENA.
</p>
<h3>5. Why personal data is processed when you use Dr.Hero
</h3>
<h4>5.1. RAW Medical’s processing of your User Data
</h4>
<p>RAW Medical processes your User Data (as described above in section 3.1) for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>to process your application or terminate your user account in the App;
</li>
    <li>to provide you with authorization to login and use your user account;
</li>
    <li>to verify your identity, age, and guardianship;
</li>
    <li>to maintain correct and up-to-date information about you;</li>
    <li>for you to be able to monitor and administer ongoing care matters;</li>
    <li>to measure and analyze the use of the App, and to improve the App and the Services;</li>
    <li>to handle your choice of settings and information about payment; and</li>
    <li>to otherwise be able to provide the Services to you according to our General Terms and Conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The legal basis for processing your User Data is that it is necessary for us to be able to provide you with the Services, and for the Healthcare Provider’s provision of good care in connection with your use of the Services. We need to process your User Data for the performance of the contract between us, which constitutes our General Terms and Conditions. The processing for the purposes of (vi) above is based on our legitimate interest to measure and analyze the use of the App, and to improve the App and the Services we provide to you.</p>

<h4>5.2. The Healthcare Provider’s processing of your Patient Data to provide healthcare services</h4>
<p>The Healthcare Provider processes Identification Data (as described above in section 3.3) for the purpose of secure identification and validation of parental responsibility before providing the Services to you.
</p>
<p>The Healthcare Provider processes Patient Data (as described above in section 3.3) for the purpose of providing the Services to you in the form of healthcare and other necessary treatment, advice, or administration, such as support for the clinicians within the scope of providing the healthcare itself.
</p>
<p>The Healthcare Provider needs to process your Identification Data and Patient Data for the performance of its contract with you. The legal basis for the Healthcare Provider’s processing of your Patient Data is that it is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, medical diagnosis, and the provision of health or social care. This may include sending you emails and other electronic communications, such as appointment reminders.
</p>
<p>The Healthcare Provider’s business operations are governed by national legislation. It therefore also sometimes processes your personal data in accordance with applicable law and as necessary to fulfill the legal obligations of the Healthcare Provider. This includes that the Healthcare Provider’s clinicians keep medical records, which the Healthcare Provider is obligated to save for a particular period of time. The Healthcare Provider also stores your medical information, such as notes from consultations, and your interactions with it for safety, regulatory, and compliance purposes. For example, it may need to review your information and, where necessary, make disclosures in compliance with reasonable requests by regulatory bodies including DHA and MOH, or as otherwise required by law or regulation.</p>
<p>The Healthcare Provider, as the data controller of your Patient Data, may use RAW Medical as a data processor to process Patient Data on its behalf to ensure that high standards of healthcare are maintained. For example, RAW Medical may process your Patient Data to analyze the efficiency of the Services, to ensure that applicable clinical and other guidelines are followed, and to follow up on any issues identified with our Services.</p>
<h4>5.3. Provision of support services related to your use of the Services
</h4>
<p>RAW Medical and the Healthcare Provider provides support as set forth above as a part of the Services (i.e. necessary to perform the contract with you and RAW Medical), which may involve responding to inquiries and investigating complaints and support matters (including technical support) through our support service by telephone or via our digital channels. To the extent, the support services are related to the care or processing of Patient Data (or sensitive personal data about you), the processing is carried out by the Healthcare Provider and takes place in order to provide you with healthcare as part of the Services and ensure high standards of quality of healthcare.</p>
<h4>5.4. To market products and services and improve your user experience</h4>
<p>RAW Medical processes some of your User Data (as described above in section 3.1) for the purposes of providing you with news, updates, and promotional content by email and text messages and other electronic communications channels, such as push notifications and in-app messages. Such communications may be based on what RAW Medical knows about you as a user and its understanding of how you use the App and the Services, for example, which features you tend to use, and which prior communications you have shown an interest in, searches you have made, your various contacts with the Healthcare Provider, as well as basic demographic and geographic data about you, such as your age, gender and the region in which you reside. However, Health Data is not used for such communication unless you have provided explicit consent to receive communication related to your health.</p>
<p>When RAW Medical contacts you for marketing-related purposes, any processing of your personal data is based on it being in its legitimate interests to do so. RAW Medical’s legitimate interests include the provision of an online service enabling easy access to healthcare professionals for therapeutic purposes. Moreover, it sends marketing-related emails and text messages on the basis of the so-called ’soft opt-in’; that is, RAW Medical obtained your contact details when you first registered with the App, that it is only sending emails and texts regarding the same or similar services, and that you were offered an opportunity to opt-out of such emails at the time. In addition, you may opt out of receiving marketing-related communications from RAW Medical at any time by updating your preferences in your account settings. As described above, any communication related to your health will only be sent based on your explicit consent.
</p>
<h4>5.5. To perform legal obligations
</h4>
<p>RAW Medical and the Healthcare Provider may also process your User Data, Health Data, and Patient Data (as described above in sections 3.1 – 3.3) to the extent necessary to fulfill their legal obligations in the field of healthcare and as otherwise set forth in statutes, court judgments, or decisions by public authorities.
</p>
<h4>5.6. To be able to evaluate, develop and improve the quality of Services
</h4>
<p>RAW Medical and the Healthcare Provider may process your User Data for the purpose of developing and improving the Services and the IT systems used to provide the Services. This is done on the basis of our legitimate interests in continually improving the security and our handling of personal data, to make the App more user-friendly, for example by changing and personalizing the user interface in order to simplify the user journey or to highlight and improve functions which we deem relevant to our users. All other development of our Services takes place using anonymized data.</p>
<p>The Healthcare Provider will only process your Patient Data for the purpose of providing the Services, to be able to ensure high standards of quality in healthcare, and to provide healthcare in accordance with applicable legislation and as described in section 5.2 above.</p>

</h4>
<p>You may receive healthcare services from the Healthcare Provider as a benefit under an insurance contract with your insurer. This may include digital GP consultations and/or telephone advice line services.</p>
